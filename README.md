# GHMM_Long

This GHMM_nD package is developed by Chao Huang and Hongtu Zhu from the [BIG-S2 lab](http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/bigs2/) and Marc Niethammer from the [uncbiag lab](https://github.com/uncbiag/). 

Gaussian hidden Markov model (Long) is a Python based package for statistical nD (n=2,3) longitudinal imaging spatial heterogeneity analysis. A Gaussian hidden Markov model is introduced to build the spatial heterogeneity of imaging intensity across different patients. The statistical inference results are used in diseased region detection in both personal level and populational level. 

# Command Script 
We provide a command script (GGHMM_run_script.py) to run the data analysis with GHMM_Long. Please see the file GHMM_run_script.py for usage. We will also provide some simulated 3D imaging dataset for testing the package.
